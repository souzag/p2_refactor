## Code Smells:
### Long Method:
"A method contains too many lines of code. Generally, any method longer than ten lines should make you start asking questions." - [refactoring.guru](http://https://refactoring.guru/smells/long-method "refactoring.guru")
- 'makePayment()': [veja aqui.](https://github.com/souzag/p2_refactor/commit/cd96f6ee3bc758d86ba6318ad6a4ebbb8689aeab "veja aqui.")
